    <div class="Lesson.name">Tables and Double Number Line Diagrams</div>
    <div class="im_student_facing_learning_goals"><p>Let&#x2019;s contrast double number lines and tables.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_learning_targets">I can create a table that represents a set of equivalent ratios.
I can explain why sometimes a table is easier to use than a double number line to solve problems involving equivalent ratios.
I include column labels when I create a table, so that the meaning of the numbers is clear.</div>
    <div class="im_glossary_entries"/>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>On a double number line diagram, we put labels in front of each line to tell what the numbers represent. On a table, we put labels at the top of each column to tell what the numbers represent.</p>

<p>Here are two different ways we can represent the situation: &#x201C;A snail is moving at a constant speed down a sidewalk, traveling&#xA0;6 centimeters per minute.&#x201D;</p>

<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/WTeXy1EtCZ4SMNa2r4Fu1VBa"/></p>

<p>Both double number lines and tables can help us use multiplication to make equivalent ratios, but there is an important difference between the two representations.</p>

<p>On a double number line, the numbers on each line are listed in order. With a table, you can write the ratios in any order. For this reason, sometimes a table is easier to use&#xA0;to solve a problem.</p>

<p>For example, what if we wanted to know how far the snail travels in 10 minutes? Notice that 60 centimeters in 10 minutes is shown on the table, but there is not enough room for this information on the double number line.</p>
