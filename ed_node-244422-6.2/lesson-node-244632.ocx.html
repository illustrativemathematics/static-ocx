    <div class="im_student_facing_learning_goals"><p>Let&#x2019;s use ratios to work with how fast things move.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_learning_targets">I can choose and create diagrams to help me reason about constant speed.
If I know that an object is moving at a constant speed, and I know two of these things: the distance it travels, the amount of time it takes, and its speed, I can find the other thing.</div>
    <div class="im_glossary_entries">meters per second: <p>Meters per second is a unit for measuring speed. It tells how many meters an object goes in one second.</p>

<p>For example, a person walking 3 meters per second is going faster than another person walking 2 meters per second.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>Suppose a train traveled 100 meters in 5 seconds at a constant speed. To find its speed in <strong>meters per second,</strong> we can create a double number line:</p>

<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/AvwRtdNaQ5aPkW8AM4cmMTeX"/></p>

<p>The double number line shows that the train&#x2019;s speed was 20 meters per second. We can also find the speed by dividing: <span><annotation description="\(100 \div 5 = 20\)"/></span>.</p>

<p>Once we know the speed in meters per second, many questions about the situation become simpler to answer because we can multiply the amount of time an object travels by the speed to get the distance. For example, at this rate, how far would the train go in 30 seconds? Since <span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

  </mrow>
  <mn>30</mn>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mn>600</mn>
</math><annotation description="\(20 \boldcdot 30 = 600\)"/></span>, the train would go 600 meters in 30 seconds.</p>
