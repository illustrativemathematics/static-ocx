<p>For thousands of years since the ancient Greeks started playing with straightedge and compass constructions, people strived to find a construction to trisect an arbitrary angle into three equal angles. Many claimed to have found such a construction, but there was always some flaw in their reasoning. Finally, in 1837, Pierre Wantzel used a new field of mathematics to prove it was impossible&#x2014;which still did not stop some from claiming to have found a construction. If we allow other tools besides just&#xA0;a straightedge and compass, though, it is possible. For example, try this method of using origami (paper folding) to trisect an angle.</p>
