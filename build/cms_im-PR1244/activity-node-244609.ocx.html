    <div class="im_extension"><p>It is commonly thought that buying larger packages or containers, sometimes called <em>buying in bulk</em>, is a great way to save money. For example, a 6-pack of soda might cost <span>$</span>3 while a 12-pack of the same brand costs <span>$</span>5.</p>
<p>Find 3 different cases where it is not true that buying in bulk saves money. You may use the internet or go to a local grocery store and take photographs of the cases you find. Make sure the products are the same brand. For each example that you find, give the quantity or size of each, and describe how you know that the larger size is not a better deal.</p>
