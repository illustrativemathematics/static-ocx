    <div class="im_statement"><p>Lin and Diego both ran for 10 seconds, each at their own constant speed. Lin ran 40 meters and Diego ran 55 meters.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Who was moving faster? Explain your reasoning.
</li>
	<li>How far did each person move in 1 second? If you get stuck, consider drawing double number line diagrams to represent the situations.
</li>
	<li>Use your data from the previous activity to find how far <em> you </em> could travel in 10 seconds at your quicker speed.
</li>
	<li>Han ran 100 meters in 20 seconds at a constant speed. Is this speed faster, slower, or the same as Lin&#x2019;s? Diego&#x2019;s? Yours?

    <div class="im_extension"><p>Lin and Diego want to run a race in which they will both finish when the timer reads exactly 30 seconds. Who should get a head start, and how long should the head start be?</p>
