    <div class="Lesson.name">Solving More Ratio Problems</div>
    <div class="im_student_facing_learning_goals"><p>Let&#x2019;s compare all our strategies for solving ratio problems.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_learning_targets">I can choose and create diagrams to help think through my solution. 
I can solve all kinds of problems about equivalent ratios. 
I can use diagrams to help someone else understand why my solution makes sense.</div>
    <div class="im_glossary_entries"/>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>When solving a problem involving equivalent ratios, it is often helpful to use a diagram. Any diagram is fine&#xA0;as long as it correctly shows the mathematics and you can explain it.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s compare three different ways to solve the same problem: The ratio of adults to kids in a school is <span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mn>2</mn>
  <mo>:</mo>
  <mn>7</mn>
</math><annotation description="\(2:7\)"/></span>. If there is a total of 180 people, how many of them are adults?</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><em>Tape diagrams</em> are especially useful for this type of problem because both parts of the ratio have the same units (&#x201C;number of people")&#xA0;and we can see the total number of parts.</p>

	<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/YwYqZQogvKDikjyZF565Wx5r"/></p>

	<p>This tape diagram has 9 equal parts, and they need&#xA0;to represent 180 people total. That means each part represents <span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mn>180</mn>
  <mo>&#xF7;<!-- ÷ --></mo>
  <mn>9</mn>
</math><annotation description="\(180 \div 9\)"/></span>, or 20 people.</p>

	<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/8pKFqw8V3bPkiDSysMrk3LGY"/></p>

	<p>Two parts of the tape diagram represent adults. There are 40 adults in the school because <span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mn>2</mn>
  <mrow>
    <mpadded height="-.1em" depth="+.1em" voffset="-.1em">
      <mstyle mathsize="1.44em">
        <mo>&#x22C5;<!-- ⋅ --></mo>
      </mstyle>
    </mpadded>
  </mrow>
  <mn>20</mn>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mn>40</mn>
</math><annotation description="\(2\boldcdot 20 = 40\)"/></span>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Double or triple number lines</em> are useful when we want&#xA0;to see how far apart the numbers are from one another. They are harder to use with very big or very small numbers, but they could support our reasoning.</p>

	<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/15aHrS2GbR5FrYKG1iDV6zFm"/></p>
	<presentation-tag src="/presentation_tags/2.tag"/>
</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Tables</em> are&#xA0;especially useful when the problem has very large or very small numbers.</p>

	<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/eTSR3nCUarcYA3YPVf1vrHbL"/></p>

	<p>We ask ourselves, &#x201C;9 times what is 180?&#x201D; The answer is 20. Next, we multiply 2 by 20 to get the total number of adults in the school.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Another reason to make diagrams is to communicate our thinking to others. Here are some good habits when making diagrams:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Label each part of the diagram with what it represents.</li>
	<li>Label important amounts.</li>
	<li>Make sure you read what the question is asking and answer it.</li>
	<li>Make sure you make the answer easy to find.</li>
	<li>Include units in your answer. For example, write &#x201C;4 cups&#x201D; instead of just &#x201C;4.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>
	<p>Double check that your ratio language is correct and matches your diagram.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
