    <div class="Activity.name">Invent Your Own Ratio Problem</div>
    <div class="im_statement"><ol>
	<li>Invent another ratio problem that can be solved with a tape diagram and solve it. If you get stuck, consider looking back at the problems you solved in the earlier activity.
</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create a visual display that includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The new problem that you wrote, without the solution.</li>
		<li>Enough work space for someone to show a solution.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Trade your display with another group, and solve each other&#x2019;s problem. Include a tape diagram as part of your solution. Be prepared to share the solution with the class.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When the solution to the problem you invented is being shared by another group,&#xA0;check their answer for accuracy.</p>
