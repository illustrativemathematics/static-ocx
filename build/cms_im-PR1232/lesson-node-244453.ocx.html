    <div class="Lesson.name">Representing Ratios with Diagrams</div>
    <div class="im_student_facing_learning_goals"><p>Let&#x2019;s use diagrams to represent ratios.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_learning_targets">I can draw a diagram that represents a ratio and explain what the diagram means.
I include labels when I draw a diagram representing a ratio, so that the meaning of the diagram is clear.</div>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>Ratios can be represented using diagrams. The diagrams do not need to include realistic details. For example, a&#xA0;recipe for lemonade says, &#x201C;Mix 2 scoops of lemonade powder with 6 cups of water.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/dyXYLPKtdb9FiGENnmHLpubQ"/></p>
<p>We can draw something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/fGPQGfvpD9cJLpKo3j36ehch"/></p>
<p>This diagram shows that the ratio of cups of water to scoops of lemonade powder is 6 to 2. We can also see that for every scoop of lemonade powder, there are 3 cups of water.</p>
