    <div class="Activity.name">Who Was Fermi?</div>
    <div class="im_statement"><ol>
	<li>Record the Fermi question that your class will explore together.
</li>
	<li>Make an estimate of the answer. If making an estimate is too hard, consider writing down a number that would definitely be too low and another number that would definitely be too high.
</li>
	<li>What are some smaller sub-questions we would need to figure out to reasonably answer our bigger question?
</li>
	<li>
	<p>Think about how the smaller questions above should be organized to answer the big question. Label each smaller question with a number to show the order in which they should be answered. If you notice a gap in the set of sub-questions (i.e., there is an unlisted question that would need&#xA0;to be answered before the next one could be tackled), write another question to fill the gap.</p>
