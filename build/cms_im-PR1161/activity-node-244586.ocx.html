    <div class="im_statement"><p>The other day, we looked at a recipe for tuna casserole that called for 10 ounces of cream of chicken soup for every 3 cups of elbow-shaped pasta.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a double number line diagram that represents the amounts of soup and pasta in different-sized batches of this recipe.
</li>
	<li>If you made a large amount of tuna casserole by mixing 40 ounces of soup with 15 cups of pasta, would it taste the same as the original recipe? Explain or show your reasoning.
</li>
	<li>The original recipe called for 6 ounces of tuna for every 3 cups of pasta. Add a line to your diagram to represent the amount of tuna in different batches of casserole.</li>
	<li>How many ounces of soup should you mix with 30 ounces of tuna to make a casserole that tastes the same as the original recipe?
