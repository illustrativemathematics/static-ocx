    <div class="im_statement"><p>The other day, we made drink mixtures&#xA0;by mixing 4 teaspoons of powdered drink mix for every cup of water. Here are two ways to represent multiple batches of this recipe:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How can we tell that <span><annotation description="\(4:1\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(12:3\)"/></span> are equivalent ratios?
</li>
	<li>How are these representations the same?&#xA0;How are these representations different?
</li>
	<li>How many teaspoons of drink mix should be used with 3 cups of water?
</li>
	<li>How many cups of water should be used with 16 teaspoons of drink mix?
</li>
	<li>What numbers should go in the empty boxes on the <strong>double number line diagram</strong>? What do these numbers mean?
</li>
</ol>
</div>
    <div class="im_extension"><p>Recall that a&#xA0;<em>perfect square</em> is a number of objects that can be arranged into a square. For example, 9 is a perfect square because 9 objects can be arranged into 3 rows of 3. 16 is also a perfect square, because 16 objects can be arranged into 4 rows of 4. In contrast, 12 is not a perfect square because you can&#x2019;t arrange 12 objects into a square.</p>

<ol>
	<li>How many whole numbers starting with 1 and ending with 100&#xA0;are perfect squares?&#xA0;
</li>
	<li>What about whole numbers starting with 1 and ending with 1,000?
