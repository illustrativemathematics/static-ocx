    <div class="im_statement"><p>The other day, we made green water by mixing 5 ml of blue water with 15 ml of yellow water. We want to make a very small batch of the same shade of green water. We need to know how much yellow water to mix with only 1 ml of blue water.</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/Me7Nx1qM1TYxJL3qH54UBZQN" alt="Double number line. Blue water, milliliters. Yellow water, milliliters.&#10;"/></p>
<ol>
	<li>On the number line for blue water, label the four tick marks shown.</li>
	<li>On the number line for yellow water, draw and label tick marks to show the amount of yellow water needed for each amount of blue water.</li>
	<li>How much yellow water should be used for 1 ml of blue water? Circle where you can see this on the double number line.</li>
	<li>How much yellow water should be used for 11 ml of blue water?</li>
	<li>How much yellow water should be used for 8 ml of blue water?</li>
	<li>Why is it useful to know how much yellow water should be used with 1 ml of blue water?</li>
