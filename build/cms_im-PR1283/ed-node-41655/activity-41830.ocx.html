    <div class="im_statement"><p>Here are 2&#xA0;intersecting lines that create 2&#xA0;pairs of vertical angles:</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/wRKstdCCFnb1reRnqJ77eCuw"/></p>
<p>1. What is the relationship between vertical angles? Write down a conjecture. Label the diagram to make it easier to write your conjecture precisely.</p>
<p>2. How do you know your conjecture is true for all possible pairs of vertical angles? Explain your reasoning.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_extension"><p>One reason mathematicians like to have rigorous proofs even when conjectures seem to be true is that sometimes conjectures that are made turn out to not be true. Here is one famous example. If we draw <span><annotation description="\(n\)"/></span> points on a circle and connect each pair of points how many regions does that divide the circle into? If we draw only 1 point there are no line segments to connect and so just 1 region in the circle. If we draw 2 points they are connected by a line segment which divides the circle into 2 regions.</p>
<ol>
	<li>If we draw 3 points on a circle and connect each pair of points with a line segment how many regions do we get in our circle?</li>
	<li>If we draw 4 points on a circle and connect each pair of points with a line segment how many regions do we get in our circle?</li>
	<li>If we draw 5 points on a circle and connect each pair of points with a line segment how many regions do we get in our circle?</li>
	<li>Make a conjecture about how many regions we get if we draw <span><annotation description="\(n\)"/></span> points on a circle and connect each pair of points with a line segment.
</li>
	<li>Test your conjecture with 6 points on a circle. How many regions do we get?
