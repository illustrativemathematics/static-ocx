	<p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards that show transformations of figures.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p>Sort the cards into categories of your choosing. Be prepared to explain the meaning of your categories.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Then&#xA0;sort the cards into categories in a different way. Be prepared to explain the meaning of your new categories.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For each card with a rigid transformation: write a sequence of rotations, translations, and reflections to get from the original figure to the image. Be precise.</p>

    <div class="im_extension"><p>Diego observes that although it was often easier to use a sequence of reflections, rotations, and translations to describe the rigid transformations in the cards, each of them could be done with just a single reflection, rotation, or translation.&#xA0;However, Priya draws her own card, shown, which she claims can not be done as a single reflection, rotation, or translation.</p>

<ol>
	<li>For each rigid transformation from the card sort, write the transformation as a single reflection, rotation, or translation.
</li>
	<li>Justify why Priya&#x2019;s transformation cannot be written as a single reflection, rotation, or translation.
