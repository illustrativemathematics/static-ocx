    <div class="im_statement"><p>Your teacher will mark points <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(B\)"/></span> on the floor. Decide where to stand so you are the same distance from point <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span> as you are from point <span><annotation description="\(B\)"/></span>. Think of another place you could stand in case someone has already taken that spot.</p>
<p>After everyone sits down, draw a diagram of what happened.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_extension"><p>In this activity, we thought about the set of points on the floor&#x2014;a two-dimensional plane&#x2014;that were equidistant from two given points <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(B\)"/></span>. What would happen if we didn&#x2019;t confine ourselves to the floor? Start with two points <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(B\)"/></span> in three-dimensional space. What would the set of points equidistant from <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(B\)"/></span> look like?</p>
