<p>The perpendicular bisector of a segment&#xA0;is a line through the midpoint of the segment that is perpendicular to it.&#xA0;</p>

    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>A <strong>perpendicular bisector</strong> of a segment is a line through the midpoint of the segment that is perpendicular to it. Recall that a right angle is the angle made when we divide a straight angle into 2 congruent angles. Lines that intersect at right angles are called perpendicular.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>A <strong>conjecture</strong> is a guess that hasn't been proven yet. We conjectured that the perpendicular bisector of segment <span><annotation description="\(AB\)"/></span> is the set of all points that are the same distance from <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span> as they are from <span><annotation description="\(B \)"/></span>. This turns out to be true. The perpendicular bisector of any segment can be constructed by finding points that are the same distance from the endpoints of the segment. Intersecting circles centered at each endpoint of the segment can be used to find points that are the same distance from each endpoint, because circles show all the points that are a given distance from their center point.</p>
