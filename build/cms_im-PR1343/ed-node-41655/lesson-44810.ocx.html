    <div class="im_student_facing_learning_goals"><p>Let's figure out&#xA0;some transformations.&#xA0;</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_learning_targets">Given a figure and the description of a transformation, I can draw the figure's image after the transformation.
I can describe a transformation that takes given points to another set of points.</div>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>Sometimes it's not hard to figure out a transformation that takes all the points of one figure directly to all the points of its image. Here, it looks like there is a 90 degree rotation that will take figure <span><annotation description="\(ABCD\)"/></span> to figure <span><annotation description="\(EFGH\)"/></span>. It is not obvious where the center of rotation would be, though.</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/M4aLqbueet6bn3daetAiZZ25"/></p>
<p>Instead, we could describe the transformation in 2 steps. First, translate figure <span><annotation description="\(ABCD\)"/></span> by the directed line segment <span><annotation description="\(AE\)"/></span>. Next, rotate the image of <span><annotation description="\(ABCD\)"/></span> clockwise by angle <span><annotation description="\(B'EF\)"/></span> using center <span><annotation description="\(E\)"/></span>. It looks like this is a 90 degree rotation, but we can be sure the rotation&#xA0;will work if we use the labels to define the rotation instead of an angle measure. This method of matching up 1 point at a time until the whole figure has been taken to the image will work for any transformation, including&#xA0;ones in which it's hard to see a single transformation from one figure to the other.</p>
