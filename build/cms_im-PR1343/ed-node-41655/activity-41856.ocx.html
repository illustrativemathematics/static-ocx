<ol>
	<li>The company wants to break the city down into regions so that whenever someone orders from an address, their order is sent to the store closest to their home. They have hired you to decide how to partition the city between the 3 stores. Explain or show your reasoning.</li>
	<li>If there are 100 employees, how should they be distributed among the 3 locations?
</li>
	<li>Is there anywhere in the city that has the same distance to all 3 stores?

	<p>Now a fourth store opens. Partition the city again.</p>

    <div class="im_extension"><p>In 1854, there was an outbreak of cholera in London. A physician named John Snow thought the water supply might be responsible. He made a map showing the location of all the water pumps in the city and the locations of all the deaths due to cholera in the city. How could he have used the ideas in this activity to help isolate the cause of the outbreak?</p>
<p>The diagrams you made in the activity and that Snow made are called Voronoi diagrams, and are still actively studied by mathematicians.</p>
