    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>In many situations, it is important to understand the reasons why an idea is true. Here are some questions to ask when trying to convince ourselves or others that a statement is true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How do we know this is true?</li>
	<li>Would these reasons convince someone who didn&#x2019;t think it was true?</li>
	<li>Is this true always, or only in certain cases?</li>
	<li>Can we find any situations where this is false?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson, we reasoned that pairs of vertical angles are always congruent to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/ah5ZhhanfbDZ9zNXsyoiXu7u"/></p>
<p>We saw this by labeling the diagram and making precise arguments having to do with transformations or angle relationships. For example, label the diagram with points:</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/Lj9JaJ1g2XuAQnCbbUqFMM4v"/></p>
<p>Rotate the figure 180 degrees around point <span><annotation description="\(E\)"/></span>. Then ray <span><annotation description="\(EA\)"/></span> goes to ray <span><annotation description="\(EB\)"/></span> and ray <span><annotation description="\(ED\)"/></span> goes to ray <span><annotation description="\(EC\)"/></span>. That means the rotation takes angle <span><annotation description="\(AED\)"/></span> onto angle <span><annotation description="\(BEC\)"/></span>, and so angle&#xA0;<span><annotation description="\(AED\)"/></span> is congruent to angle&#xA0;<span><annotation description="\(BEC\)"/></span>.</p>
<p>Many true statements have multiple explanations. Another line of reasoning uses angle relationships. Notice that angles <span><annotation description="\(AED\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(AEC\)"/></span> together form line <span><annotation description="\(CD\)"/></span>. That means that <span><annotation description="\(x + y = 180\)"/></span>. Similarly, <span><annotation description="\(y + w = 180\)"/></span>. That means that both <span><annotation description="\(x\)"/></span> and <span><annotation description="\(w\)"/></span> are equal to <span><annotation description="\(180-y\)"/></span>, so they are equal to each other. Since angle <span><annotation description="\(AED\)"/></span> and angle <span><annotation description="\(CEB\)"/></span> have the same degree measure, they must be congruent.</p>
