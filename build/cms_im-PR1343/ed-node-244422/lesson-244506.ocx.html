    <div class="Lesson.name">Color Mixtures</div>
    <div class="im_student_facing_learning_goals"><p>Let&#x2019;s see what color-mixing has to do with ratios.</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_learning_targets">I can explain the meaning of equivalent ratios using a color mixture as an example.
I can use a diagram to represent a single batch, a double batch, and a triple batch of a color mixture.
I know what it means to double or triple a color mixture. </div>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>When mixing colors, doubling or tripling the amount of each color will create the same shade of the mixed color. In fact, you can always multiply the amount of <em>each</em> color by <em>the same number</em> to create a different amount of the same mixed color.</p>
<p>For example, a batch of dark orange paint uses 4 ml of red paint and 2 ml of yellow paint.</p>
<ul>
	<li>To make two batches of dark orange paint, we can mix 8 ml of red paint with 4 ml of yellow paint.</li>
	<li>To make three batches of dark orange paint, we can mix 12 ml of red paint with 6 ml of yellow paint.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a diagram that represents 1, 2, and 3 batches of this recipe.</p>
<p><img src="https://staging-cms-assets.illustrativemathematics.org/e42Kesdpeg8AXgzeUpddbHTM" alt="A discrete diagram for two quantities labeled &#x201C;red paint (ml)&#x201D; and &#x201C;yellow paint (ml)&#x201D;.&#10;&#10;The data are as follows: 1 batch orange, 4 red squares and 2 yellow squares.&#xA0;2 batches orange, 8 red squares and 4 yellow squares.&#xA0;Three batches orange, 12 red squares and 6 yellow squares.&#10;"/></p>
<p>We say that the ratios <span><annotation description="\(4:2\)"/></span>, <span><annotation description="\(8:4\)"/></span>, and <span><annotation description="\(12:6\)"/></span> are <em>equivalent</em> because they describe&#xA0;the same color mixture in&#xA0;different numbers of batches, and they make the same shade of orange.</p>
