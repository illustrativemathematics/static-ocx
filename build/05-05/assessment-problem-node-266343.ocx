    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>A bag contains 150 marbles. Some are blue, and the rest are white. There are 21 blue marbles for every 4 white marbles. How many blue marbles are in the bag? Explain your reasoning.<presentation-tag src="/presentation_tags/5.tag"></presentation-tag><presentation-tag src="/presentation_tags/5.tag"></presentation-tag><presentation-tag src="/presentation_tags/5.tag"></presentation-tag></p>
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><p>126 blue marbles. Explanations vary. Sample explanation: Make a table in which the first row has 21 blue marbles and 4 white marbles. We want to find the row where the total number of marbles is 150. Multiplying the first row by 6 gives 126 blue marbles and 24 white marbles, which add to the correct total of 150.</p>

<p>Minimal Tier 1 response:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Work is complete and correct.</li>
	<li>Sample: <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="44929">\(21\boldcdot6=126\)</span>, so there are 126 blue marbles and 24 white marbles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tier 2 response:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Work shows general conceptual understanding and mastery, with some errors.</li>
	<li>Sample errors: blue and white marbles are in the correct ratio but do not total 150; correct answer with no work shown and no explanation; work involves some correct reasoning about equivalent ratios with some errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tier 3 response:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Significant errors in work demonstrate lack of conceptual understanding or mastery.</li>
	<li>Sample errors: Work does not show evidence of an understanding of equivalent ratios; incorrect answer with no work shown.</li>
</ul>
