    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>Lin is buying snacks for a large sporting event. Each person at the event will get one piece of fruit. Lin knows from past events that for every 3 people who took an orange, 4 people took an apple. She expects 140 people at the event. How many of each kind of fruit should she buy?&#xA0;Explain your reasoning.</p>
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><p>60 oranges and 80 apples. Possible explanation: For every 3 oranges there are 4 apples. Think of these 7 fruits as one &#x201C;batch.&#x201D; Here is a table that could be used to represent this problem:&#xA0;</p>
