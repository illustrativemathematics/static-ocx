    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>A school baseball team sells refreshments at their games to raise money for the team. At the second game, they make <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="4027">\(\frac65\)</span> as much money as they made at the first game. Did they make more money at the first or second game? Explain how you know.</p>
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><p>They made more money at the second game. <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="4027">\(\frac65\)</span> is greater than 1 (since <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="10665">\(\frac55\)</span> is equal to 1), and when you multiply by a number greater than 1, you get a larger value.</p>
