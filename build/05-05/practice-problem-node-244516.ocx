    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>Jada gets her favorite shade of purple paint by mixing 2 cups of red paint with 3 cups of blue paint. Jada mistakenly mixes 3 cups of red paint with 2 cups of blue paint.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Find a way Jada can correct her mistake to get her favorite shade of purple. Explain your reasoning.</li>
	<li>Find a way Jada can correct her mistake if she has no more red paint. Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><ol>
	<li>Answers vary. Sample response: She has to create a ratio of red to blue that is equivalent to <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="9460">\(2:3\)</span>. For example, she could add 1 cup of red paint and 4 cups of blue paint to the mixture so that it has 4 cups of red paint and 6 cups of blue paint, which is two batches of purple paint.</li>
	<li>She could add <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="8938">\(2\frac{1}{2}\)</span> cups blue paint. Sample explanation: Because the amount of red paint is <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="3217">\(1\frac12\)</span> times the amount in the recipe, she could make <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="3217">\(1\frac12\)</span> batches of purple paint by&#xA0;adding&#xA0;blue paint&#xA0;so that the amount of blue paint is&#xA0;<span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="3217">\(1\frac12\)</span> times the amount in the recipe. <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="47569">\(1\frac12 \boldcdot 3 = 4\frac12\)</span>. To make <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="3354">\(4\frac12\)</span> cups of blue paint, she would need to add <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="8938">\(2\frac{1}{2}\)</span>&#xA0;cups of blue paint to the 2 cups of blue paint that is already there.</li>
