    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>Diego usually makes rice by combining 4 cups of water with 2 cups of rice and 1 teaspoon of salt. He made rice 4 times last week, but each time using&#xA0;different amounts of the ingredients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On Monday, he used 8 cups of water, 4 cups of rice, and 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
	<li>On Wednesday, he used 12 cups of water, 6 cups of rice, and 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
	<li>On Friday,&#xA0;he used 2 cups of water, 1 cup of rice, and <span class="math math-repaired" data-png-file-id="238">\(\frac12\)</span> teaspoon of salt.</li>
	<li>On Sunday he used 16 cups of water, 8 cups of rice, and 5 teaspoons of salt.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>On which day did the rice taste saltier than usual? Explain how you know.</li>
	<li>On which day did the rice taste less salty than usual? Explain how you know.</li>
	<li>On which day did he make exactly 2 batches of his usual recipe?</li>
</ol>
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><ol>
	<li>The rice was saltier on Sunday, because there was&#xA0;4 times as much water, 4 times as much rice, and 5 times as much salt.</li>
	<li>The rice was less salty on Wednesday, because there was&#xA0;3 times as much water, 3 times as much rice, but only 2 times as much salt.</li>
	<li>Monday, because all ingredient amounts were&#xA0;doubled.</li>
</ol>
