    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>Diego and Priya each rode their bicycle at a constant speed. Diego traveled 7 kilometers in 60 minutes. Priya traveled 2 kilometers in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Did they travel at the same rate? Explain your reasoning.</p>
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><p>No, they did not travel at the same rate. Priya traveled faster. Sample reasoning:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are four 15 minutes in 60 minutes, so Priya would travel <span class="math math-repaired">\(4 \boldcdot 2\)</span> or 8 kilometers in 60 minutes, 1 kilometer more than Diego traveled in that amount of time.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using a double number line, we can see that Priya would ride 8 kilometers in 60 minutes, while Diego rode 7 kilometers in 60 minutes.</p>

	<p><img src="/tikz_files/205233.svg" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>Diego biked <span class="math math-repaired">\(\frac{7}{4}\)</span> or 1.75 kilometers in 15 minutes, which is a shorter distance than Priya traveled in 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>
