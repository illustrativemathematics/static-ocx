    <div class="im_statement"><p>Your teacher will time how long it takes a student to move from the start line to the finish line of a path.&#xA0;</p>

<ol>
	<li>How many seconds did it take the student to travel from start to finish?&#xA0;</li>
	<li>Suppose another student also moved along the same path but did it more quickly. How would the amount of time change?</li>
	<li>In the experiment, the student began moving from a warm-up mark that was before the start line. Why might it be important for the experiment?</li>
