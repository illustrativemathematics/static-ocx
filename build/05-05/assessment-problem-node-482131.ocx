    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>Lin is making pancakes using a pancake mix and water. In her recipe, the ratio of cups of pancake mix to cups of water is $4 : 3$.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<ol>&#xD;
	<li>Lin mixes 20 cups of pancake mix and 15 cups of water. Is this ratio of pancake mix to water equivalent to that in the recipe? Explain your reasoning.</li>&#xD;
	<li>Find two ratios of cups of pancake mix to cups of water to make pancakes that would taste the same as the recipe. Show your reasoning.</li>&#xD;
</ol>&#xD;
</div>
    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><ol>&#xD;
	<li>Yes. Sample reasoning: Both the cups of pancake mix and the cups of water are 5 times the numbers in the original recipe ($20 = 5 \boldcdot 4$ and $15 = 5 \boldcdot 3$). Lin is making 5 batches of the recipe.&#xA0;</li>&#xD;
	<li>Sample response: $8 : 6$ and $2 : 1\frac{1}{2}$. The first ratio is for 2 batches of pancakes: $2 \boldcdot 4 = 8$ and $2 \boldcdot 3 = 6$. The second ratio is for half a batch: 2 is half of 4 and $1\frac{1}{2}$ is half of 3.</li>&#xD;
