    <div class="AssessmentProblem.statement"><p>In a school, the ratio of teachers who wear glasses to those who don&#x2019;t is 7 to 2.</p>

<ol>
	<li>If there are 10 teachers who don&#x2019;t wear glasses, how many total teachers are at the school?</li>
	<li>Explain why you chose the strategy you did to solve the problem.</li>

    <div class="AssessmentProblem.solution"><ol>
	<li>
	<p>45 teachers. Sample reasoning:</p>

	<p><img src="/tikz_files/205236.svg" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>Sample response: With a tape diagram I can see the parts in the ratio (7 and 2) and the total number of parts (9). If the 2 parts for teachers who don&#x2019;t wear glasses represent 10 teachers, each part represents 5 teachers and 9 parts represent <span class="math math-repaired">\(9 \boldcdot 5\)</span> or 45 teachers.</li>
