    <div class="im_extension"><p>One reason mathematicians like to have rigorous proofs even when conjectures seem to be true is that it can help reveal what assertions were used. This can open up new areas to explore if we change those assumptions. For example, both of our proofs that the measures of the angles of a triangle sum to 180 degree were based on rigid transformations that take lines to parallel lines. If our assumptions about parallel lines changed, so would the consequences about triangle angle sums. Any study of geometry where these assumptions change is called non-Euclidean geometry. &#xA0;In some non-Euclidean geometries, lines in the same direction may intersect while in others they do not. In spherical geometry, which studies curved surfaces like the surface of Earth, lines in the same direction always intersect. This has amazing consequences for triangles. Imagine a triangle connecting the north pole, a point on the equator, and a second point on the equator one quarter of the way around Earth from the first. What is the sum of the angles in this triangle?</p>
