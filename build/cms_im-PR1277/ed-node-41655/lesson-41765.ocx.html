rigid transformation: <div>

<div>
<p>A rigid transformation is&#xA0;a translation, rotation,&#xA0;or reflection. We sometimes also use the term to refer to a sequence of these.</p>

theorem: <p>A statement that has been proved mathematically.&#xA0;</p>
</div>
    <div class="im_student_lesson_summary"><p>A figure is called <strong>congruent</strong> to another figure if there is a sequence of translations, rotations, and reflections that takes one of the figures onto the other. This is because translations, rotations, and reflections are rigid motions. Any sequence of rigid motions is called a&#xA0;<strong>rigid transformation</strong>.&#xA0;A rigid transformation is a transformation that doesn&#x2019;t change measurements on any figure. With a rigid transformation, figures like polygons have corresponding sides of the same length and corresponding angles of the same measure.</p>
<p>The&#xA0;result of any transformation is called the <strong>image</strong>. The points in the original figure are the inputs for&#xA0;the transformation sequence and are named with capital letters. The points in the image are the outputs and are named with capital letters and an apostrophe, which is referred to as&#xA0;&#x201C;prime.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There are many ways to show that 2&#xA0;figures are congruent since many sequences of transformations take a figure to the same image. However, order matters in a set of instructions. Sometimes we can switch 2&#xA0;steps in a sequence and get the same output, but other times, switching 2&#xA0;steps results in a&#xA0;different image. These 2&#xA0;sequences of transformations both have the points <span><annotation description="\(A\)"/></span>, <span><annotation description="\(B\)"/></span>, and <span><annotation description="\(C\)"/></span> as inputs and points <span><annotation description="\(A&#x2019;&#x2019;\)"/></span>, <span><annotation description="\(B&#x2019;&#x2019;\)"/></span>, and <span><annotation description="\(C&#x2019;&#x2019;\)"/></span> as outputs. Each step in the sequences of rigid transformations creates a triangle that is congruent to triangle <span><annotation description="\(ABC\)"/></span>.</p>
