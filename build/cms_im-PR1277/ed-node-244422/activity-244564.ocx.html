	<li>Compare your double number line diagram with your partner. Discuss your thinking. If needed, revise your diagram.</li>
	<li>How many cups of white paint should Elena mix with 12 tablespoons of blue paint? How many batches would this make?</li>
	<li>How many tablespoons of blue paint should Elena mix with 6 cups of white paint? How many batches would this make?</li>
	<li>Use your double number line diagram to find another amount of white paint and blue paint that would make the same shade of light blue paint.</li>
	<li>How do you know that these mixtures would make the same shade of light blue paint?
